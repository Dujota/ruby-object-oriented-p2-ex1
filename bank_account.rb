# Create a class called BankAccount.
class BankAccount
  # Add a class variable called @@interest_rate that is a float representing the interest rate for all the accounts in the bank. This is a class variable because it is the same value for all accounts.
  # Add another class variable called @@accounts that starts as an empty array. This will eventually store the list of all bank accounts in the bank.

  def self.create
    @@accounts << BankAccount.new #calls BankAccount.new and adds the new object to @@accounts so that we can find it again in the future. --- basically the idea is : the bank can store the accounts it has into a list(array) and then check back on how many accounts they hold vs the instance of account which can only see that particular customer's account
    return @@accounts.last ### this is so we return the newest accoutn that is being created with this class method. the bank can check the total # of accounts any time by accessing @@accounts array
