# Create a class called BankAccount.
class BankAccount
  # Add a class variable called @@interest_rate that is a float representing the interest rate for all the accounts in the bank. This is a class variable because it is the same value for all accounts.
  # Add another class variable called @@accounts that starts as an empty array. This will eventually store the list of all bank accounts in the bank.
  @@interest_rate = 0.0
  @@accounts = []



  def self.create
    @@accounts << BankAccount.new #calls BankAccount.new and adds the new object to @@accounts so that we can find it again in the future. --- basically the idea is : the bank can store the accounts it has into a list(array) and then check back on how many accounts they hold vs the instance of account which can only see that particular customer's account
    return @@accounts.last ### this is so we return the newest accoutn that is being created with this class method. the bank can check the total # of accounts any time by accessing @@accounts array
  end

  #Add a class method called total_funds that returns the sum of all balances across all accounts in @@accounts.
  #This needs to be a class method because it does not pertain to any single, specific account.
  def total_funds

  #Add an initialize instance method that sets @balance to zero. You should also add reader and writer methods for balance to your class. Balance is stored in an instance variable because the value needs to be different from account to account.
